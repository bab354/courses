Local configuration of SQL environments can be a pain, so I made it browser based in order to avoid this hassle.

Steps to set up the class:

1. Go to: https://www.db-fiddle.com/
2. In the left side of the screen, paste the text in the "SQL Class - Schema.pdf" document
      - This builds two (simple) tables that we will be using to query off of in the exercises
      - NOTE: The data are fake
3. In the right side of the screen, you can write queries to answer the questions. Browser-based SQL can be a little finicky when it comes to writing multiple queries so it's best to do it one at a time
